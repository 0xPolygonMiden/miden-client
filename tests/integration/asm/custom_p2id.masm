# Custom P2ID note script
#
# This note script asserts that the note args are exactly the same as passed 
# (currently defined as {expected_note_arg_1} and {expected_note_arg_2}).
# Since the args are too big to fit in a single note arg, we provide them via advice inputs and 
# address them via their commitment (noted as NOTE_ARG)
# This note script is based off of the P2ID note script because notes currently need to have 
# assets, otherwise it could have been boiled down to the assert.
